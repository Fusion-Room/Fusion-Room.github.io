       <p>
           The CREEES Fusion Room is a space that has been designed from the ground-up to let students and researchers experiment with using technology in their work. The do-it-yourself movement popularized the concept of “Maker Spaces”. A Maker Space is a deliberately constructed place where people go to make things they otherwise wouldn’t be able to make, with tools and expertise they normally wouldn’t have access to. The Fusion Room aims to be a Maker Space for the Digital Humanities.</p>

        <p> While still a work in progress, the space already features:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Two high performance media workstations
            </li>
            <li>Video conference equipment</li>
            <li>Displays for use with personal devices</li>

        </ul>



          <p> You can follow the progress on a public Trello board here.
